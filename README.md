# Chemistry-Sim
An unfinished terminal based chemistry simulation 

# Running
This can be compiled with the command:
```
g++ main.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```
# Features
Currently you can only create a hydrocarbon and perform two reactions, halogenation and alkylation. These reactions can be done with different reagents with different resurlts.
WARNING: The stereochemistry is a bit wonky and may produce innacurate results.
